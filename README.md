# 3DVerb

## About
- 3DVerb is a VST3 reverb audio plugin made with the JUCE framework.
- 3DVerb utilizes the `juce_audio_basics` module `Reverb` class (`juce_Reverb.h`) as a reference plugin.
- It processes real-time audio data, and passes that data to a JUCE WebView frontend.
- The UI integrates [ThreeJS WebGL animation library](https://threejs.org/) 
and the Three Nebula library [independent library for ThreeJS](https://github.com/creativelifeform/three-nebula) that simplifies certain animations like particle emission.

## Goals
- Proof of concept: audio plugins, enabled by Juce WebView2 for 3D visualizations, can react in real time to real-time data and visualize that data artistically in three dimensions.
- Push for audio plugins to be less utilitarian: Many people utilize their DAW for general music practice and don't necessarily need all their CPU power dedicated to dozens of plugins.
- Provide a relaxing virtual environment for users to visualize their music in real time.
- Practical uses:
    - Demonstrate flexibility of JUCE WebView paradigm for visualization purposes.
    - View how reverb parameters affect frequency distribution in real-time--useful for mixing as reverb can saturate low or high frequencies depending on parameter settings.
    - Visual supplement to music performance.
    - Education: view how reverb algorithm affects frequency data. Visualize how parameter changes affect high frequency attenuation.

   - Navigate to your build directory: `3DVerb\Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Debug\VST3`
   - Select the 3DVerb.vst3 file and add it to the filter graph

### Development Notes

#### TODO

- Installation instructions for CMAKE and macOS users needed.
- Create a production branch.
- Prepare for release by determining WebView requirements and/or updating relevant code to check for environment.


## Features
- Three-dimensional visualization of JUCE reference reverb algorithm [Freeverb implementation](https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/pasp/Freeverb.html)
- Utilization of event-driven JUCE WebView paradigm.
- Hot-reload of frontend:
    - decouples visualization development from audio processing development.
    - save time not rebuilding each time the code for visualization is updated.
- Real-time parameter mapping between JUCE AudioProcessor and WebView frontend.
- Thread-safe data exchange using lockless programming techniques.
- Maxed out FPS on a mid-range PC.
- Responsive 3D camera controls using ThreeJS `OrbitControls` extension.
- Frequency-only FFT extracts frequency data for visualization in a "particle wave."
- Visual feedback for reverb tail length and decay characteristics.
- Particle density and behavior controlled by output level and interaction of primary reverb parameters.
- Visualization features extracted from primary params for a reactive real time visualization.
- Interaction with ThreeJS Mesh objects and utilization of Three Nebula initializers and behavior physics.
- Change ThreeJS environment map from a predetermined list.
- JUCE `UndoManager` integration with undo/redo buttons and ctrl+z, ctrl+y keyboard shortcut integration.

## Parameter Mapping

### Primary params of 3DVerb

| Parameter | Type | Range | Default | Step | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| Bypass | Bool | 0/1 | false | - | Bypasses the reverb effect |
| Mono | Bool | 0/1 | true | - | Forces mono output processing |
| Gain | Float | 0.0 - 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.01 | Output gain control |
| Size | Float | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.01 | Room size/reverb decay time |
| Mix | Float | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.75 | 0.01 | Wet/dry signal balance |
| Width | Float | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.75 | 0.01 | Stereo width of reverb effect |
| Damp | Float | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.01 | High frequency damping amount |
| Freeze | Float | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.01 | (a boolean is set true by range being greater than 0.5) Freezes reverb tail (infinite sustain) |

### Parameter to visualization mapping

| Audio Parameter | Visual Element | Mapping Description |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Room Size | Particle Spread | Larger values increase particle distribution radius. Radius of emitted particles scales up or down. Surrounding glass cube increases in size |
| Mix | Anchor spheres | Anchor spheres scale up and down |
| Damping | Particle Color | Higher damping (threshold = damping > 0.45) shifts particles toward warmer colors on collision with surrounding cube |
| Damping / Room Size interaction | Particle Density | Controls life of particles inside surrounding cube |
| Frequency Data | Particle Wave Region Height | FFT freq. bins mapped to Y-axis particle positions in a sine wave animation |
| Frequency Data | Particle Wave Scale | FFT freq. bin level controls individual particle scale |
| Freeze Mode | Animation Speed | Freezes particle motion when enabled |

## Screenshots

As this is a dynamic visualization, screenshots are only half the story, but these will give an idea as to how the visualization
responds to parameter changes at a high level.
